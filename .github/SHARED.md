# Shared

What BevyCSharp and 3DEngine have in common, and which of the two has solved what. The engines
are built differently, one over Bevy through a bridge and one on its own Vulkan renderer, and they
answer many of the same questions: how a behavior is written, what the ECS offers it, how states,
physics, scenes and saves work, how a running app is driven from a terminal, and how the project
is tested, packed and versioned. An answer one of them finds is offered to the other as an idea,
and each implements it in its own way.

This file is the same in both repositories and has one writer, the session that writes
[REVIEW.md](REVIEW.md). The session working on a repository offers something for it with a line
under Replies in REVIEW.md that begins `Shared:`, and may read the other repository for the model
it names, without editing it.

## What counts

An idea is shared when it changes what somebody using the engine writes or can rely on. How it is
built underneath is each engine's own and is not recorded here.

Shared areas:

- behaviors and the generators behind them, with their attributes and diagnostics
- the ECS a behavior reaches: queries, filters, change detection, the hierarchy, commands
- states and their transitions
- physics over BepuPhysics: bodies, colliders, joints, contacts, characters
- scene files, saves, data in files, and files that outlive a renamed type
- input, including what a script injects
- the command-line tool that drives a running app (`bcs`, `e3d`)
- tests, the games built from the package, measurement, CI, packing and the version
- the rules for prose and commits

Not shared:

- rendering, which is Bevy's in BevyCSharp and the engine's own in 3DEngine
- the editor, which BevyCSharp has and 3DEngine has decided against
- the flat raylib-style API, which is 3DEngine's alone

## The ledger

One row an idea. The state of the engine that lacks it is `to take`, `taken at` a commit, `to
consider` for an idea that is not scheduled and is taken only if it comes to suit that engine,
`does not apply` with the reason, or `waits on the owner`. A row stays once both have it, since the
table also answers whether the two agree.

### Behaviors and generators

| A contact says how hard its pair hit, as the speed they closed at | to take | has (`ContactStarted.Speed`, `c5227118`) |
