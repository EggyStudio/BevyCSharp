# Review

Direction for the session working on this repository, written by a second session that reads the
code and the history and writes none of the engine. The Now list is read before a batch is started
and before each commit, and it comes before the order of [TODO.md](TODO.md).

This file has one writer. The session doing the work edits the Replies section only, and records
what it carries out in the documents it keeps (TODO.md and the plans beside it). An item is
removed from here once the commit that settles it has been read. A stash of every changed file
takes what was written here since the last commit out of the tree until it is popped, so a stash
names its own paths.

Reviewed up to `e9a8508e`. One commit, and item 4's mesh shaders are in: a program draws on a camera
with Slang task and mesh stages, `DrawTask` and `DrawMesh` as roles 12 and 13 laid out as a pass,
which with the draw fragment beside them are compiled to SPIR-V, the one way Slang writes them, and
built into a mesh pipeline by the bridge itself in `mesh_draws.rs` from passthrough modules, the
compute path's module and layout drawn out for both; a draw counts them in workgroups,
`ViewDraw.Meshes` or three unsigned integers of a buffer, mode 2 of a 64-byte `BcsViewDraw`, ABI
240, sizes and offsets held in both languages; the camera's inputs layout is visible to the task and
mesh stages where the device has them, a pipeline that could not be built is kept as nothing rather
than tried every frame, a mesh draw casts no shadow and says so once, and a count of the wrong kind
is refused naming the factory. mesh_shader_intro is written, each cube's color once a corner since
Slang declares nothing a fragment shader reads per triangle, its triage note and the ledger saying
so; four tests draw the halves of the view by a task shader's payload, by the mesh shader's
workgroups alone and by an indirect count, and refuse the two wrong settings, each skipped where the
device runs no mesh shaders; a bridge test reads the two stand-ins through naga; the guide's section
and seventeen C# blocks build on a fresh pack. The finding: an error scope around the mesh pipeline
was popped out of order a few runs in ten and wgpu panicked, once on the building thread and once in
Bevy's `load_module`, so the pipeline is built without one; read here, the stack of scopes is the
device's one, which Bevy's cache pushes its own on from its loading threads, so the compute path's
scope stands in the same race (Verdict 8), and the lesson is a row of SHARED.md beside Slang's.
Right, the pipeline built where Bevy's cache cannot name an entry point, the cached and the own
pipeline behind one enum, and the three passes drawing by one method. `NativeTypes.Render.cs`,
listed under N 1.3 at 1,047 lines, was touched without its mend (Verdict 9). The suite: 1,317
passed, 2 skipped, the Solari rays test given 3,600 frames after running out of 1,200 while
compiling, as its sibling was. The next page says where the three mesh tests ran, the device's mesh
shaders being wgpu's experimental feature; item 4 goes on with what the table names most, in the
order it has.

Before it, one commit came to be read, and item 4's shader gaps came to be whole:
`App.AddComponentArray<T>` keeps every entity's component in one storage buffer a shader reads at
the entity's mesh tag, as Bevy's `GpuComponentArrayBuffer` does, managed-side alone over the buffer
calls and the reflected mesh tag, so no bridge change and no ABI change. At the end of every frame
it scans the entities with the component: a new one takes the next place and the tag, a changed one
is written again, one that lost the component or was despawned gives its place to the last entry,
which is retagged, and a living entity that lost it loses its tag; the buffer grows by half as
Bevy's does and is written whole only when something changed; a scan rather than component hooks,
since hooks are one a component type and the game's to use, said in the remarks; and a struct shared
with a structured buffer spells its padding out, which the guide says. The test draws two squares of
one material in their entries' colors, recolors one and despawns the other, the survivor keeping its
color through its new tag; gpu_component_array_buffer is written with .NET's random numbers from
Bevy's seed, the triage saying the cubes fall in other places and no bare-Bevy frame compared for
it, rightly; the guide's nine C# blocks build against a scratch pack. Right, the array built from
what the bridge already gives and its two limits said where a reader finds them, the tag the array's
and one entity in two arrays unsupported as in Bevy. The suite: 1,314 passed and 2 skipped.
mesh_shader_intro next as a gap of its own, Slang's task and mesh stages through SPIR-V on Vulkan,
which this machine's driver reports, as item 4 has it.

Before it, one commit came to be read, pipeline constants: a Slang `[SpecializationConstant]`, an
`override` in WGSL, is set on a material by name as any value is and compiled into pipelines of its
own for each set of values. Reflection reads each constant's name, id and type from Slang's JSON for
those the stage's WGSL kept, since naga refuses a key its module does not declare, so each stage
carries its own list and a constant one stage kept and another left out is still the material's; the
check takes one number for a constant; the material's key gains the constant values as bits by name,
so each set gets its pipelines; the 3D specialization and a new 2D one hand each stage the constants
it declares; and a pass's or dispatch's pipeline being shared by every instance of its program, a
constant there is refused once the program has compiled and reported at pack if set before, through
one flag in each of the six pack contexts. No new API and no ABI change, the guide gaining a
section. pipeline_constants is written and matches bare Bevy's frame with no pixel past 3%; a bridge
test holds a constant kept and one dropped and the one-number check, and two managed tests hold two
materials of one program drawn apart by their constants and redrawn when one changes, and an
instance refusing a constant. Right, the constants reflected only where the stage kept them, which
is the thing naga would otherwise refuse at pipeline time, and the refusal where a pipeline is
shared said plainly. The suite: 1,313 passed and 2 skipped. gpu_component_array_buffer next, drafted
on the managed side: `AddComponentArray<T>` keeping each entity's T in a shader buffer at the end of
every frame with a mesh tag an entity, the last entry swapped into a freed place and retagged as
Bevy does, the buffer grown by half.

The norm has 44 rules, and this engine stands at 31 checked, 4 with places listed, none to take and
9 by review.


## Now

The owner asked that the work does not stop. A batch that ends is followed by the next item here
with no wait for a reply, and the list is long so that it does not run out. Items 5 to 10 are taken
from [SHARED.md](SHARED.md).

1. **What the next page says.** The run of `a54dda9e`, the first since `c7f1cbc6` and the first
   green on every system since the bump, passed 1,051 on Linux, 922 on macOS and 929 on Windows with
   425 to 435 skipped where the runner draws nothing, and its page repeats only the five lines a
   test prints and the two warnings a test asks for; Verdicts 4, 5 and 6 are settled, the runs of
   `7849ecf6`, `d6764154`, `827b382e`, `095bccd7` and `2359425d` are green on all three as well, and
   the pack job did not run, so Verdicts 2 and 3 settle on the pack run's page, which is the owner's
   to start (Decision 8). Verdict 7 is settled at `b0fa935e`, the page removed before the script
   starts, and `61f80bc6` asks whether it is there first, since the runtime's Windows delete throws
   on a missing folder, a fresh checkout's first run. `SpawnedWindowTests`' black capture is traced
   at `c46fd24e`, the window's image holding its zeros until the pass that draws it has its
   pipeline, and the test captures once `Render.PipelinesReady()` holds; `Render.Screenshot`'s
   remarks for a window and `docs/window.md` say so with step g. The page's repeated lines carried
   116 warnings of `Screen.Playing` in every run since before `c70f17b`, quieted at `37b2118f`, the
   harness adding `Screen` beside the behaviors it discovers, so the warning shows once, from the
   test that asks for it, and the third repeated line is the 67 errors `ShaderMaterialTests` asks
   for (Decision 7). Package 0.4 is ready to pack on Bevy 0.20 (Decision 8), `a54dda9e`'s run green
   and item 3's steps in at `c9c460df`, and Verdicts 2 and 3 settle on that pack run's page. The
   cheat sheet is its writer's again at `d6764154`. N 4.7's list in `NormTests` names ASKS.md, which
   is in, and the owner's `5a7f2c07` is on `build/norm/7.2.txt`, both at `5bbbe1a5`. The run of
   `e9a8508e` says where the three mesh shader tests ran and where they skipped, the device's mesh
   shaders being wgpu's experimental feature. Each push's run is read by the reviewing session, and
   a failure it names comes first here.

2. **The norm's lists are paid down.** A listed file is mended when a batch next touches it, in a
   commit of its own that moves code alone, the largest first where there is a choice, and a batch
   reads the lists for the files it will touch before it starts. Every rule is checked or by review
   since the run of `156d2ce` passed on macOS, N 6.2 the last taken. N 1.3's test counts the Slang
   shaders of the bridge and the examples as it counts the C# and the Rust, as 3DEngine's does since
   its `09419080`, none of them over 800 today, so the list stays as it is.

3. **Bevy 0.20.** The owner chose it on 2026-10-09 (Decisions 17 to 20), and the crates' word is
   typed by the owner into the working session, as AGENTS.md has it, before a manifest changes. Bevy
   0.20.0 was published on 2026-10-08 with wgpu and naga 30, winit 0.30, gilrs 0.11 and nonmax 0.5
   unchanged, a minimum Rust of 1.97.1 that this machine, the portable image and the runners meet,
   and every one of the 70 `bevy/*` features the bridge names. In this order, each step a commit of
   its own where it stands alone.

   **The spike first.** 0.20 replaces naga_oil with WESL: `#import` becomes `import ...;`, `#ifdef
   X` becomes `@if(X)`, `#define_import_path` is gone, GLSL is gone, and Bevy's modules move
   (`bevy_pbr::forward_io` to `bevy_pbr::render::forward_io`, `mesh_view_bindings` under
   `bevy_pbr::render`, `prepass_utils` to `bevy_pbr::prepass::utils`). Nothing a game wrote changes,
   since games write Slang and no shader in the repository uses those forms. The bridge's glue in
   `programs/wgsl.rs` does, ten `#import bevy_pbr::{...}` blocks and some thirty `#ifdef`s, built at
   `programs.rs:569` with `Shader::from_wgsl`, which becomes `Shader::from_wesl` for a glued unit
   while plain Slang output stays `from_wgsl`, and `programs.rs:555` names units for naga_oil's
   registry where WESL imports by path. Whether WESL's parser takes slangc's WGSL with the glue in
   front is unknown, so the first commit compiles the feature test's nine programs and the examples'
   shaders through `from_wesl` on 0.20 and reports what it refused, before anything else is touched.

   **The manifests and the mechanical moves**, with `cargo check` on headless, render and editor,
   with meshlets and Solari, and `cargo test`: observers `On<Add, A>` to `On<Add<A>>` (observe.rs,
   solari.rs, meshlets.rs); flat pointer events, `Pointer<Press>` to `PointerPress` (pointer.rs,
   input.rs, pick.rs); `ShaderBuffer` typed over `AlignedVec`, `new` taking a `Vec<T>`, `set_data`
   and `resize_in_place` gone (43 uses across pools, rays, views, compute, material, shaders,
   passes, values and instances); extraction generic over worlds, `#[extract_app(RenderApp)]`,
   `SyncComponent<RenderApp>`, `TemporaryRenderEntity::default()` and `extract()` in `bevy_extract`
   (47 uses); `ViewPrepassTextures::depth` an `Option<DepthStencilAttachment>` and
   `ViewDepthTexture` renamed `ViewDepthStencilTexture` (views.rs, passes.rs, watch.rs);
   `ExtractedWindows` a `Query<&ExtractedWindow>` (window.rs); `bevy_shape` and `bevy_curve` split
   from `bevy_math` (14 uses); `to_dynamic` returning `Result` (reflected.rs, render/scene.rs);
   `Ptr::as_ptr` returning `*const u8` (ecs.rs, reflected.rs); `Name::from(&str)` wanting `'static`
   (`clips.rs:259`); `DeferredWorld::query` deprecated; and `ui::Interaction` deprecated, an error
   under the workflow's denied warnings, so `Ui.InteractionOf` and `UiInteraction` keep their
   surface over `Hovered` and `Pressed`. In the interface, `BorderRadius` fields are `CornerRadius`,
   `EditableText` and `TextInput` are two components with `TextScroll` gone into
   `EditableText::viewport`, `FontSource`'s generic families are constructors, Escape releases text
   focus and propagates, `FocusCause::Auto` is new, `Node` requires `EmSize`, and the default font
   size is `rem(1)` where it was `px(20)`. `SolariLighting` has ReSTIR off by default and new fields
   (world cache size, light samples, temporal accumulation, bounces); `restir` is chosen by
   measurement on the comparison page, and the fields stay the camera's, reached through its
   reflected `SolariLightingRef`, since a copy in `Config` would be a second home for what the
   camera holds (`c9c460df`).

   **The embedding ported in.** `bevy_embedded_assets` 0.16 targets 0.19 alone; its build script
   (139 lines, reading `BEVY_ASSET_PATH`, which `build/build-native.sh --embed` already sets), its
   reader (382) and its plugin (179), in `.ref/bevy_embedded_assets-main`, become the bridge's own
   `build.rs` and an `embedded` module behind the `embed` feature, replacing `EmbeddedAssetPlugin`
   at `app.rs:91`, `cargo-emit` left out since a build script prints its own directives, the crate's
   MIT or Apache-2.0 notice kept for what was taken, and the dependency removed (Decision 17).

   **The weather vendored and ported.** `bevy_weather` 0.2.0 targets 0.19.1 alone and has one
   maintainer; its source in `.ref/bevy_weather-main` becomes a workspace member
   `native/bevy_weather` in upstream's shape with its LICENSE.md, the bridge depending on it by
   path, and is ported there: four shader loads whose `sky.wgsl` and `precipitation.wgsl` carry five
   preprocessor lines, converted to WESL and renamed `.wesl`; five `AsBindGroup` derives and eight
   material impls; 34 atmosphere sites against an atmosphere that is per camera in 0.20
   (`AtmosphereBuffer` a component, `init_atmosphere_buffer` gone). The Weather page and the drive
   script pass as before, and the port is offered upstream by the owner (Decision 18).

   **The schema and the files.** `bevy-components.tsv` written again from an editor build as
   BUILDING.md has it, its diff read as what Bevy changed; `ABI_VERSION` and `ExpectedAbiVersion`
   bumped together. `Tonemapping` and `DebandDither` move from `bevy_core_pipeline::tonemapping` to
   `bevy_render::view`, and `games/Courtyard/assets/levels/courtyard.scene.json` names the old
   paths, as a user's scene would; SCENES.md §7 gives Bevy's reflected components no former names,
   so both would be kept and reported in `SceneLoad.Refused` and the camera would lose them. A moved
   Bevy type gets former paths, a column or a sidecar beside the tsv that the generator reads as it
   reads `FormerNames`, so a file written on 0.19 keeps reading, Courtyard's file left as it is for
   the proof.

   **What a game's author sees, measured.** `ScreenSpaceTransmission` is opt-in on `Camera3d`, so
   the transmission example and the gallery add it and `docs/materials.md` says so; `Camera2d`
   defaults to `Tonemapping::Linear` and `Tonemapping::None` is a full passthrough, so
   `TonemapRampTests` may fail for `None.png`, which is rewritten with the reason if the change is
   Bevy's (3DEngine's copies follow, SHARED.md); sprites draw through `Mesh2d` with an `alpha_mode`
   and same-Z order may change; Bevy's own sets order weakly, so a bridge system that leaned on an
   unstated order between two of Bevy's may move. The suite on three systems, every capture compared
   and each difference named as Bevy's or a fault, the feature test driven through every zone inside
   `systemd-run --user --scope -p MemoryMax=20G -p MemorySwapMax=0`, the soak, Courtyard from the
   package. The suite is run once more with `ScheduleBuildSettings::shuffle_seed` set, which
   `bevy/debug` offers and the headless profile has, and what it finds is mended or listed. The
   crash file's logic of `6363357` is read against 0.20, where a panic in a system becomes an error
   for `FallbackErrorHandler`, which re-panics by default, so the hook fires twice; a Rust panic
   reported to the managed side as C# exceptions are is noted for item 5 and not taken here.

   **Documents and the table.** `docs/compared-with-bevy.md` and `docs/how-it-works.md` name 0.19,
   PLAY.md names the two crates' 0.19 releases at lines 132 and 180, BUILDING.md's bridge package
   table loses the embedding's row and changes the weather's, and `slang.rs:3` explains WGSL by
   naga_oil; `THIRD-PARTY-NOTICES.md` written again, the vendored weather and the embedding's source
   named; EXAMPLES.md written again from the lock, 0.20's list holding 422 examples with 23 new to
   triage in `triage.tsv` (`deferred_raymarch`, `mesh_shader_intro`, `sprite_material`,
   `shader_material_2d_bindless`, `pipeline_constants`, `gpu_component_array_buffer`,
   `compressed_image_saver`, `extra_source`, `headless_tabs`, `character_creation`,
   `feathers_number_input`, `inline_image`, `fixed_node`, `overflow_transform`, `draggable_slider`,
   `mutation_by_reflection`, `mines`, `many_meshlet_materials` and three `pan_orbit_camera_*`) and
   22 gone from it; the release notes name each change above that a game's author sees, with its
   reason and no one who decided (N 4.7). The 115 ports whose heads say v0.20.0 and whose code
   follows 0.19.1 (`384f9150`'s reply) are headed 0.19.1 with the next commit, their pictures
   written again on 0.20 where step f named the difference as Bevy's, and each is ported to 0.20's
   code under item 4 in the order of how much Bevy changed it, its head and picture moving with it,
   the twenty built on Feathers in 0.20 (`faecca0b`'s reply) going with Feathers after the other
   gaps, and context_menu going with the gap that brings the list box, multiple_text_inputs in at
   `5bbbe1a5` with the field's edits and multiline_text_input at `827b382e` with its viewport and
   cursor (`2e7a1c2c`'s reply); 2d_gizmos, 3d_gizmos and wireframe the same, for the gizmo lines'
   animation offset and the wireframe's x-ray, and tab_navigation's Tab, which moves no focus in an
   offscreen run, is traced with the keys' gap (`a54dda9e`'s reply).

   **The pack run for 0.4**, green on Linux, macOS and Windows and playing Courtyard, settles the
   item (Decision 8).

4. **The gaps, by how many rows each holds**, each bridged from Bevy with the examples it unlocks
   written in its batch: a decal's tag and a volume's voxels through the WESL glue (in with
   `340639b1`), `deferred_raymarch` on the deferred buffers (`7849ecf6`), the widgets' events as
   observers with `headless_tabs` and `draggable_slider` (`01b5ac3e`), keys observed as they reach a
   field (`5bbbe1a5`), `sprite_material` and `shader_material_2d_bindless` as 2D materials
   (`467efee0` and `855c4b7e`), `inline_image` and `fixed_node` in the interface (`095bccd7`),
   `pipeline_constants` (`4e3dd60a`) and `gpu_component_array_buffer` (`2359425d`) in shaders, mesh
   shaders from Slang through SPIR-V (`e9a8508e`), and what the table then names most, in this
   order: the four rows that can be written as they are, `overflow_transform`,
   `many_meshlet_materials`, `test_meshlet` and `mines`; the standard material's depth and specular
   maps, `parallax_mapping`, `specular_tint` and `deferred_rendering`'s forward-in-deferred
   material; and Bevy's diagnostics store, `custom_diagnostic`, `enabling_disabling_diagnostic` and
   `log_diagnostics`. The dev tools' three, `fps_overlay`, `infinite_grid` and `scene_viewer`, wait
   on the owner's word for their crate as Feathers' do (Decision 11), and the remote protocol's
   three stay as they are, `./bcs` being this engine's own. When the captures have settled, they are
   compared whole with checked-in references by the workflow, a small share of pixels allowed to
   differ between devices, as 3DEngine does for its scenes. Transmission's glass spheres are missing
   from about one capture in four with TAA on, before `6a84286` as after it, so the cause is found
   before that job is red for them, or the example is compared with its spheres left out and the
   reason beside it. `dragdrop_picking`'s pale preview draws over the words Bevy sorts it under
   (`b548987`'s reply), untraced, and is traced before those captures are compared, as is the
   gallery's anisotropic spheres drawing blown white under SSAO with forward rendering though they
   have tangents and draw right under deferred, Bevy's prepass normal for an anisotropic material
   the suspect (`edd577c`'s reply), and the camera's volumetric fog hazing the whole picture, the
   sky with it, once a depth prepass is on the camera, which the hall works round by putting the fog
   on the camera only while it is inside (`6a19213`'s reply). Feathers' three examples with
   `feathers_number_input` and the three camera controllers follow the other gaps, their crates
   allowed (Decisions 11 and 12) on the owner's word in the working session, and the four font
   examples stay missing (Decision 13). `compressed_image_saver` comes last here, for the scene
   packs' textures as KTX2 in BCn or ASTC with their mipmaps, less memory after the kill of
   2026-10-08.

5. **Every method native code calls catches every exception**, from 3DEngine's `NormTests.N_2_10`
   (`48fbb663`): a test finds a callback the bridge calls that lets an exception through, by how it
   is handed over, and each is mended to report it instead, so no exception crosses the bridge from
   a system, an observer or a loader's callback.
6. **A template package, so `dotnet new` starts a game**, from 3DEngine's `3DEngine.Templates`
   (`ec7e6c3c`): a template of a console game on the package, installed and used by the pack
   workflow, as the first game's first step would have a newcomer do.
7. **The entities that lost a component since a system last ran**, from 3DEngine's `Removed`
   (`ab052859`): a query's filter or a world call answering the entities a component was removed
   from since the system's last run, beside the added and changed ones a behavior reads.
8. **Every example compiles on the package alone**, from 3DEngine's
   `build/examples-on-package.sh` (`a61308b0`): 208 of 231 examples call helpers of the examples
   project, so what they share to say a thing in one word becomes the package's own calls or stays
   in the example, and the workflow builds every example on the packed package.
9. **A script that more than one system runs is read for the forms only GNU's tools or a later
   bash read**, from 3DEngine's `ScriptTests` (`fd7b17f3`): one test over the scripts the workflows
   and a developer run on Linux, macOS and Windows' Git bash, where one line was found there.
10. **Fixes for the generator's diagnostics offered in an editor**, from 3DEngine's
    `3DEngine.CodeFixes` (`c6b529d4`): a code fix beside each diagnostic the behavior and command
    generators report, so an editor offers the mend.

## Verdicts

2. **The pack job of `421d4e1` fails in `NormTests.N_6_4` and `N_6_5`, the package tests, before
   they open the package.** Read from the owner's paste of the job: `DirectoryNotFoundException` for
   `BevyCSharp.Tests/bin/Release/net10.0/build/package/BevyCSharp.0.4.88.nupkg`. The step exports
   `BCS_PACKAGE` as `ls build/package/*.nupkg`, a path relative to the checkout, and the tests open
   it from their own working directory, `bin/Release/net10.0`, so the two never meet; the tests
   passed only where nobody set the variable and they skipped. Two things: the tests resolve a
   relative `BCS_PACKAGE` against the repository root, as the norm's other tests find their files,
   so the variable works from any directory, and the step exports an absolute path as well,
   `$PWD/...`, so the job does not lean on the test. The pack job was the first to run these tests
   with a package in hand, which is why the test suite never showed it. The same job's build prints
   21 warnings, CS1573, CS1735, CS8604, CS8620, xUnit2029 and RS1032, which `4308619` has since
   mended, with `-warnaserror` on every managed build.

3. **The pack run of `421d4e1` fails in the step that plays Courtyard, with exit code 1 and no
   reason.** Read from the run's jobs: `package / play Courtyard` failed at its ninth step, `Play
   Courtyard`, after the bridge and the package were built, and the job's annotations hold the
   build's warnings and `Process completed with exit code 1`, nothing of the game. The pack run of
   `b263f6d` had skipped the step, so this is the first time the game was played from the package
   since the page came, and whatever stopped it is in a log nobody reads, as 3DEngine's first-person
   walk was (its Verdict 28). Two things, as there: the game is played here as the workflow plays
   it, from the packed package by `bcs`, to find what stopped it; and every step of the pack
   workflow that runs a program ends with a page or an `::error::` naming the step, the command, its
   exit code and its last lines at a warning or worse, which 3DEngine's `build/step.py` and
   `build/page.py` do, taken from there (SHARED.md), with their tests under `TestScriptTests`.
   Settled when a pack run plays Courtyard and says so.

8. **The SPIR-V compute pipeline is built inside an error scope that shares the device's one stack
   with Bevy's shader cache, so the race `e9a8508e` met at the mesh pipeline stands there.** The
   mesh pipeline's scope was popped out of order a few runs in ten, once on the building thread and
   once in Bevy's own `load_module` on an async compute thread, and wgpu panicked; wgpu keeps one
   stack of scopes a device, and Bevy's cache pushes its own around each module it loads on those
   threads, so two scopes from two threads interleave and a pop meets the other's. The compute build
   in `spirv_compute.rs` pushes the same kind of scope while Bevy's cache loads modules at the same
   moment of a start, the window the mesh runs showed in a few of ten and the compute tests in none
   of eight, which is its width and not its absence. The scope goes as the mesh pipeline's did, a
   compute pipeline that fails to build a render error as any other, closing the app unless
   `Shaders.KeepRenderingAfterErrors` says not to, which the `ComputeTarget` remarks say in place of
   the pipeline going unbuilt; wgpu's error sink and Bevy's `ShaderCache` are read once to confirm
   the stack is the device's, said in the module comment where the mesh pipeline's says it. Settled
   when the scope is gone, the remarks changed and the compute tests pass.

9. **`e9a8508e` touches `NativeTypes.Render.cs`, listed under N 1.3 at 1,047 lines, without the mend
   item 2 asks.** A listed file is mended when a batch next touches it, in a commit of its own that
   moves code alone, and a batch reads the lists for the files it will touch before it starts; the
   batch added `DrawTask`, `DrawMesh` and the three group counts to it and left it as it was. The
   mend comes next in a commit of its own, the render structs split by what they describe so each
   file is under 800 lines, the sizes' and offsets' tests unchanged; `programs.rs` at 785,
   `shader_views.rs` at 768 and `draws.rs` at 761 are read for the same before the batch that next
   grows them. Settled at the commit.

## Decisions

1. **Commits stay local.** The owner pushes `main` from their own tools, and the working session
   commits and does not push, as COMMITS.md and AGENTS.md say. An earlier entry here that allowed
   pushing is withdrawn by the owner.
2. **AGENTS.md's bullet on SHARED.md is the owner's.** They approved it on 2026-10-04, and it is
   committed like any other change.
3. **A picture opens the example's own source, and not Bevy's live demo of it.** The owner chose
   it on 2026-10-05, and `57fc7e9` carried it out.
4. **AGENTS.md's bullet on NORM.md is the owner's, with the exception N 7.4 makes.** They approved
   both on 2026-10-05 in the reviewing session, with the plan for the norm. A working session
   that commits a change to its instruction file only on the owner's word in its own session
   is right to, and waits for that word.
5. **The examples written are brought to B 4 a group at a time.** The owner chose it on
   2026-10-05, over leaving them as they are and over doing them all before other work.
6. **A run that fails says what failed in a page, and the reviewing session is given no log.**
   The owner chose it on 2026-10-05, after a log pasted into the reviewing session ended it.
   The suite runs whole, and in parts only after a process is lost, and a test in which the
   engine logs an error fails unless it says it expects that error. The norm has these as
   N 6.7, N 6.8 and N 3.7, and the reviewing session reads a run's jobs and annotations from
   GitHub.

7. **The page's repeated lines are warnings and errors.** The owner chose it on 2026-10-06, after
   the page of `98f6d8e5` repeated the engine's banner, so the section counts what is logged at
   warning or error or with no level and is left out when nothing repeats.

8. **The next package is 0.4.** The owner chose it on 2026-10-06 for the ABI's moves from 199 and
   the surface added since 0.3.2, `build/version.txt` holding `0.4` so the patch counts itself,
   packed when the owner chooses. On 2026-10-09 the owner chose that 0.4 waits for Bevy 0.20 and is
   packed on it, its release notes naming the move.

9. **A document a game's author reads names no one who decided.** The owner asked on 2026-10-06
   that release notes and the documents under `docs/`, the README and the cheatsheet give reasons
   and not who wanted what, which is N 4.7, and who chose what stays here under Decisions.

10. **The tests run on macOS as well.** The owner chose it on 2026-10-07, the package being
    built for osx-arm64 and osx-x64 while the suite ran on Linux and Windows alone; N 6.2 asks for
    every desktop system the package ships for, and `macos-latest` joined the matrix at `6528ea2`.

11. **Feathers' crate may be enabled, after the other gaps.** The owner allowed it on 2026-10-07
    for `feathers_counter`, `feathers_gallery` and `virtual_keyboard`, Bevy's `bevy_feathers`
    feature; the working session adds the crate on the owner's word in its own session, as AGENTS.md
    has it.

12. **The free and pan camera controllers may be enabled, after the other gaps.** The owner
    allowed it on 2026-10-07 for `free_camera_controller` and `pan_camera_controller`, Bevy's
    `free_camera` and `pan_camera` features with the `bevy_camera_controller` crate, on the same
    word in the working session. On 2026-10-09 the owner extended it to the pan-orbit controller,
    which 0.20 upstreamed into the same crate as `PanOrbitCamera`, so the word, when typed, names
    all three.

13. **System font discovery stays off.** The owner chose it on 2026-10-07: its Linux backend
    links fontconfig at build time, and the bridge builds with nothing but a C compiler, so a font
    by family name is not offered, the four font examples stay missing with that reason, and
    `docs/ui.md` says why without naming anyone (N 4.7).

14. **The sample becomes a feature test.** The owner decided on 2026-10-07 that
    `BevyCSharp.Sample` is renamed `BevyCSharp.FeatureTest` and stays in the solution, puts every
    feature on one map with a capsule character on four course zones, a PBR sphere grid, a Cornell
    box, vegetation, a lights gallery and Bevy's atmosphere with a C# time of day, has an admin
    panel and a Source-style console in Dear ImGui with settings kept in a file, logs a crash to a
    file beside the executable, and is published native for Windows x64 and Linux x64 as a zip for
    testers. `bevy_weather` comes as its own batch once the map stands, for stars, the moon, clouds,
    fog, rain and snow drawn around Bevy's atmosphere, its crate added on the owner's word in the
    working session, and volumetric clouds are not written by hand.

15. **Graphics test scenes come as packs fetched on demand, never checked in.** The owner
    decided on 2026-10-07: Intel Sponza first, its textures at 1K, the pack a release asset of this
    repository, fetched by the feature test's panel and by `bcs` on demand and cached for the user,
    with Bistro, the classic Sponza and San Miguel left for later; the repository holds the
    manifests and the script that makes a pack. Sponza stands on the feature test's map at ground
    level with its main door open, for the character to walk in, and its heaviest meshes are drawn
    as meshlets, to test them, where the GPU can.

16. **Every tonemapper here comes to 3DEngine.** The owner decided on 2026-10-08 that 3DEngine
    takes Bevy's eight tonemappers, the three drawn through lookup tables from Bevy's own data and
    the others ported from Bevy's shader, so the two engines draw one picture from one value; this
    side's part is the proof, a ramp drawn through each tonemapper and kept as references that
    3DEngine's test compares its own picture with, the ramp defined in SHARED.md.

17. **The embedding is the bridge's own.** The owner chose on 2026-10-09 that
    `bevy_embedded_assets`, whose 0.16 targets Bevy 0.19 alone, is ported into the bridge's source
    as a build script and an asset reader behind the `embed` feature, its MIT or Apache-2.0 notice
    kept, and the dependency removed.

18. **The weather is vendored and ported.** The owner chose on 2026-10-09 that `bevy_weather`, whose
    0.2.0 targets Bevy 0.19.1 alone and has one maintainer, is kept as a workspace member under
    `native/` in upstream's shape with its license and ported to 0.20 there, the port offered
    upstream, over waiting with the weather off and over dropping it.

19. **Bevy 0.20 comes after the deferred batch in flight and before the other gaps.** The owner
    chose it on 2026-10-09, over upgrading at once with the batch set aside and over finishing every
    gap on 0.19, since each gap bridged into Bevy's WGSL on 0.19 would be written again under WESL.

20. **The crates' word for the upgrade.** Bevy 0.20.0 with wgpu and naga 30, the embedding ported in
    and its crate removed, `bevy_weather` vendored under `native/` and ported, and nothing else
    added, typed by the owner into the working session, as AGENTS.md asks, before a manifest
    changes. DLSS waits for a tester to ask, Solari and meshlets stay additions outside the package,
    and Feathers' new widgets and theming stay under Decision 11.

21. **No document or comment a reader sees names the owner or a session.** The owner ordered it on
    2026-10-09 after a dependency row in 3DEngine's DESIGN.md said who admitted a crate and when; N
    4.7 reaches every Markdown file but REVIEW.md, SHARED.md, NORM.md, AGENTS.md and COMMITS.md and
    the comments of every source, script, manifest and workflow, in both repositories, and who chose
    what stays in REVIEW.md's Decisions.

22. **Content streamed on the go stays in the ledger, and the browser stays out.** The owner chose
    on 2026-10-09, after reading a browser port of a large game that downloads its world as it is
    played, that the idea is recorded in SHARED.md as the file layer that port has (packs on a
    static host, reads by byte range into a block cache, a recorded first-run set, prefetch by the
    game's own streaming), to consider until a game here ships a world too large to download first,
    over a streaming file layer in both engines and over an HTTP source alone, since nothing here
    needs it today; and that the browser is out, as BUILDING.md has it, since .NET in the browser
    calls only native code linked into its own build and Bevy's web runtime is another toolchain
    that owns the page's loop.

23. **A run that shows no window makes no sound.** The owner ordered it on 2026-10-10, since a
    hidden or offscreen run, a test or a soak, played through the machine's speakers; its audio goes
    to no device or a device of silence, sounds still run their course, and a config field turns
    real audio on for such a run.

24. **A game's session writes what the engine lacks in `.github/ASKS.md`, here as in 3DEngine.** The
    owner ordered it on 2026-10-10, when the session making a voxel game in `3DEngine.Game` found
    the sun's shadows costing the GPU 14.8 ms and the CPU 13 ms over some 1,800 draws, every chunk
    drawn once a cascade with no culling, and had no way to tell the engine's session: the game's
    session writes an entry there with what it measured and how, the reviewing session turns it into
    an item of the Now list by its weight and writes the item's number under the entry, and the
    engine's session reads REVIEW.md as before; no game of this engine has written one yet;
    AGENTS.md names the file beside SHARED.md and NORM.md, with the owner's word, and the engine's
    session writes nothing in it. ASKS.md and AGENTS.md's bullet on it are the reviewing session's
    and are committed with whichever batch comes next, as REVIEW.md is; a game's own files are the
    game's session's to commit.
