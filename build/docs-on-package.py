"""Builds every C# block of the guides under docs/ against the packed package, so a block that
calls what the surface no longer has fails the run with its page and block named.

    build/docs-on-package.py [page.md ...] [--package DIR] [--version VERSION] [--keep DIR]

Each ```csharp block becomes a file of a project outside the repository on the package in
build/package, or the folder --package names, at the version --version names or else the one packed
last, as build/examples-on-package.sh builds the examples.
Each block's lines are sorted by what they declare at its own level, types going in a namespace of
the block's own, members (a method, a field, a property) in a class of its own, and statements in a
method of it, inside a loop run once so a fragment's continue and break have one. The method takes
a behavior's context, `ctx`, and an app being built, `app`, where most of the guide's statements
are written, and a fragment follows the lines a comment before its fence gives, which declare
what else it takes from the page around it:

    <!-- compiled with:
    Vector2 player = default;
    -->

A block a comment before its fence marks as skipped, with its reason, is left out:

    <!-- not compiled: a sketch of a shader's code, in Slang -->

Every file takes the usings each page's blocks name and the library's own. An error is said with
the page and its line, as a GitHub annotation under GitHub Actions. docs/first-game.md is left out,
since build/first-game.sh builds every step of it as a whole program. --keep writes the project to a
folder to look at, where it is otherwise thrown away.
