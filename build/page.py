A run's log and its summary need a reader signed in to GitHub, and its annotations do not, so a
failure is said in an annotation as well as on the page, which is the job's summary (NORM.md, N 6.7).
build/test.py writes the tests' page with these, and build/step.py the error of a step that fails
having said nothing.
